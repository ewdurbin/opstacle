opstacle
========

An SMTP proxy built around
`inbox.py <https://github.com/kennethreitz/inbox.py>`__ which attempts
to maintain some sanity as your servers begin to send thousands of
emails just cause.

The basic premise is emails from a given server or process will happen,
but all 1300 aren't really necessary right this instant. god forbid if
you pay by the smtp delivery.

Installation
------------

``pip install opstacle``

Configuration
-------------

opstacle is configured only by environment variables, and our
contestants are:

Pretty things
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``OPSTACLE_FROM_ADDRESS``
-  Most messages will be simply relayed without modification, but we
   need our own name when we send rolled up emails
-  Sample Value: "Opstacle opstacle@opstacle.io"

Threshold configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``OPSTACLE_INTERVAL``
-  Interval to keep counters when messages have been sent, in seconds

-  Sample Value: 5

"Fake" SMTP server (where opstacle will listen)
